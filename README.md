This set of experiments has the following objectives:

<ul>

 <li>Familiarization with pt-51 board.</li>

 <li>Familiarization of breaking down a problem into subproblems and using subroutines to solve a problem.</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>Install FLIP (for windows user) or DFU Programmer for Linux users. This software is used to program the pt-51 board.</li>

 <li>Read the value of the switches (p1.3-p1.0) to get the delay <em>D </em>and perform the following task.

  <ul>

   <li>Toggle the first LED (p1.7) with a delay of <em>D </em></li>

   <li>Toggle the second LED (p1.6) with a delay of</li>

   <li>Toggle the third LED (p1.5) with a delay of</li>

  </ul></li>

</ol>

The minimum value of <em>D </em>can be 1 second. As an example, if <em>D </em>is 4, then p1.7 (LED) should toggle with 4s delay, second LED should toggle with 2s delay and third LED should glow with 1s delay. Demonstrate the delay of each port pins in the logic analyser to your TAs. (5 points)
